### Setting up Node Version

To ensure you are using the correct Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file, run the following command:

```shell
nvm use
```

If you don't have nvm (Node Version Manager) installed, follow the instructions here to install it.

For more details about nvm, you can visit their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

### Environment Variables

This project requires certain environment variables to be set.
You can find a template for these variables in the .env.example file.
To create your own .env file, run the following command:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, edit the .env file to include the appropriate values for your setup.
